<h3>Are there any fees for members?</h3>
<p><strong>Absolutely <u>NOT</u>!</strong> There are no fees whatsoever for members. Most sites will at the very least charge you up to 20% withdraw fee but we do not have any withdraw fees, no signup fees, no earnings limits. No fees - EVER!
</p>

<h3>What about advertisers?</h3>
<p>There are no hidden fees for advertisers. The total you see during the purchase checkout is the price you pay! No tricks, no gimmicks. Just honest, quality advertising at great prices. </p>

<h3>How do I pay?</h3>
<p>We currently accept Alertpay and eGold for advertising purchases.</p>

<h3>How does PTC work?</h3>
<p>When you purchase PTC hits (or link ad hits), your advertisement will be listed for members to click.  The members must view your site for a predetermined amount of time based on the class of advertisement and then click a specified number before being credited for the view. There are 4 different ad classes: A, B, C, and D. The difference is that the better class rating a link has, the higher it will display on our list of ads - and also the longer the members must stay at your site. The timer amounts are 10, 20, 30, and 40 seconds respectively. Your ad will also be displayed for free in our ad archive where you will receive free hits for as long as we are online!</p>

<h3>Are the hits unique?</h3>
<p>Yes. Each member is only allowed to view your site once per 24 hours. We strictly enforce expunging duplicate accounts to ensure that you get the best possible throughput for your money. </p>

<h3>What kind of sites can I advertise?</h3>
<p>You may advertise any kind of site as long as it does not break our terms of service. We do not allow any sites relating to or in connection to illegal activities, adult content, gang or hate based, or otherwise non-family oriented topics. </p>

<h3>What is GotBux?</h3>
<p>Gotbux is a get-paid-to program that will pay you for the simple actions of clicking and signing up for websites. We provide advertisers a way to expand on their marketing techniques to broaden their audience and potential profitability.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Advertisers purchase ads on our site and in turn, we pay you to view those ads. For PTC, you view websites for 10-30 seconds each and then once you verify the view by clicking a prompted number, you will be credited with cash in your account. For the PTSU, you must register at the advertiser's specified site and then submit your welcome email to us. The advertisers will then verify your submission and you will get paid $0.10 per signup.</p>

<h3>Earning with referrals</h3>
<p>We offer an excellent referral program where you earn <strong>100%</strong> of your referrals earnings! If you referred 100 members, and they all clicked 10 links per day, you could earn up to $300 per month!</p>

<h3>Can other people in my house join?</h3>
<p>Yes as long as you have separate alertpay accounts.</p>

<h3>Can I have more than one account?</h3>
<p>No, you cant.</p>

<h3>How much can I make?</h3>
<p>There are no limits to the earnings you can make. Again, we do not charge you any fees whatsoever and we do not place any caps on your account.</p>

<h3>How do I refer others?</h3>
<p>When you are logged in, click on the "promote" link at the bottom of the site to be taken to your promotion page. Here you will find your own unique referral URL to promote.</p>

<h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
<p>Once you have reached at least $1 balance, you may request payment via Alertpay. We do not charge any withdraw fees like most programs which means it truely is 100% free to use our program!</p>

<h3>When do I get paid?</h3>
<p>You will receive your money within 7 days after requesting.</p>
